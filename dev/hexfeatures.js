Please Note: All outlined below, as well as any related
features noted as part of that description, are purely at
the discretion of the DM.
aquifer: underground layer of water-bearing permeable
rock or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt)
from which groundwater can be extracted using a
water well; 1-in-3 chance = naturally tapped
barachois: a coastal lagoon separated from the ocean
by a sand or shingle bar
bight: sharp bend in the coast
blowout: a sandy depression formed by winds and lack
of vegetation
cave, fracture: formed when layers of more soluble
minerals, such as gypsum, dissolve out from between
layers of less soluble rock; rocks fracture and collapse
in blocks of stone
cave, limestone: solutional cave where rock has been
dissolved by natural acid in groundwater seeping
through bedding-planes, faults, joints, etc.
cave, lava tube: formed through volcanic activity
cave, talus: opening between rocks that have fallen
down into a pile, often at the base of cliffs
cloud forest (fog): moist forest characterized by a
persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover,
usually at the canopy level
copse: thicket or grove of small trees
crater lake: lake formed in collapsed volcanic mountain
crooked trees: unexplained grove of twisted and/or
deformed trees
cuesta (w/ cliff): ridge with a gentle slope on one side
and a cliff on the other
cypress dome: type of swamp, typically dominated
by pond cypress
dell: small retired valley; dale
den tree: tree with cavities suitable for habitation,
usually by birds or mammals
draw: formed by two parallel ridges or spurs with low
ground in between them
escarpment: wide steep slope
esker: narrow ridge of gravelly and sandy drift deposited
by a stream in association with glacier ice
fluvial terrace: elongated terrace that flanks the side
of floodplain or fluvial valley
hillock/knoll: small hill
hoodoo (tent rock): tall, thin spire of rock that
protrudes from the bottom of an arid drainage basin
or badland
kettle (lake): shallow, sediment-filled body of water
formed by retreating glaciers or draining floodwaters
lava dome: roughly circular mound-shaped protrusion
resulting from the slow extrusion of viscous lava from
a volcano
lava lake: large volume of molten lava contained in a
volcanic vent, crater, or depression
limestone pavement: flat, incised surface of exposed
limestone resembling artificial pavement
mangrove swamp: area where evergreen trees and
shrubs thrive in tideland mud or sand flats inundated
daily with sea water
pebble beach: beach formed by pebbles (as opposed
to fine sand)
playa: broad, level spot where water temporarily
accumulates after rains
primeval forest: forest that has attained great age
without significant disturbance
pseudocrater: volcanic landform resembling true
volcanic crater, but is not an actual vent from which
lava has erupted
riparian zone: interface between land and a river or
stream
shingle beach: beach formed by small- to mediumsized
cobbles (as opposed to fine sand)
spring, artesian: confined aquifer wish flows upward
naturally without the need for pumping
strath: river valley of considerable size
tor: rocky peak
turbid water: water in which particulate matter (both
inorganic and organic waste) is suspended
vernal pool: temporary pools of water providing
habitat for distinctive plants or animals
volcanic cone: formation in the shape of a cone with a
central cater
volcanic crater: circular depression in the ground
caused by volcanic activity
volcanic vent: opening in ground through which
molten lava, ash, and/or gases are ejected
volcanic vent w/ tuff ring: as volcanic vent, with
additional outer ring of fragmented layers of volcanic
material
wolf tree: very large tree with wide-spreading crown
that has inhibited/prevented the growth of smaller
trees around it
