        <p>This app was meant to help you with all your cosmic adventures.  
        It is web based, but we are working on an offline version.  
        It has a minimal design, and should work just as well on phones and tablets.
        </p>
        <p>You can save anything you create – and it will be saved locally to your device.  
        When you come back you can load what you saved.  If you clear your history or cache for

        <strong>Current Utilities:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HexMap Builder</strong>
          <p>Create your own hex based maps for your game.  Edit the terrain of individual hexes, and populate them
          with cities, ruins, lairs, and more.
          </p>
          <li><strong>Fantasy Plot Generators</strong>
          <p>Two different Random Plot Generators - one from the JTeam and the other from the 
          <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/124392/d30-Sandbox-Companion?affiliate_id=569798" class="strong">d30 Sandbox Companion</a>.
          Both create a number of adventure prompts. Each adventure has its own villain, plot, location and factions – all randomly generated.
          </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong><a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/156979/The-Perilous-Wilds?affiliate_id=569798" class="strong">
            Perilous Wilds</a> Dungeon Generator</strong>
            <p>Generates a dungeon filled with a random number of areas.    
            Areas may have themes, features, creatures, traps and/or loot.
            There are no grids here - pure theater of the mind.  
            <p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>People/Creature Generator</strong>
          <p>This randomly generates "races" and creatures based on tables found in Perilous Wilds.  
          No statistics are provided, but most will have special ability "tags" to make them unique. 
          </p>
          </li>

            Traveller RPG</a> Star System Generator</strong>
            <p>Generates a random star system based upon tables found in the SRD.</p>
