          Cosmic Power is about not just saving the world, but saving multiple worlds.  
          It is about galactic scale superheroes.  The rules utilize Sine Nomine Publishing’s 
          Godbound ruleset for playing demigods, and makes some tweaks to adapt it to the cosmic superhero genre.  
          Godbound is an excellently written book by Mr. Kevin Crawford and it is available in a 
          <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/185959/Godbound-A-Game-of-Divine-Heroes-Free-Edition?affiliate_id=569798">
          <em>free version</em></a> (all the basic rules for play) as well as a 
          <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/185960/Godbound-A-Game-of-Divine-Heroes-Deluxe-Edition?affiliate_id=569798">
          <em>deluxe edition</em></a> that has art and some extra content.     
        </p>
        <p>
          Cosmic Power also adds some tools for play without a GM - or at least make a GM’s life easier.  
          Sometimes there just isn’t someone to come up with the story for the evening, 
          but you can still play a game with your friends.

      <h3 class="center header">Incursions</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          When an Outsider launches a blatant assault on a city of a civilized world 
          it is called an Incursion.  The section that follows details the steps to run 
          an Incursion for a quick evening of play with minimal setup.  An Incursion 
          generator is included with CPX Utilities.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Incursion take place across a number of Sectors (5 is a good round number).  
          The size of Sectors are nebulous, as is their layout.  Using the generator 
          you can generate a random Hex Map layout for your Incursion.  To quickly represent 
          this on a table you can use an equal number of sticky notes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Every player should select a marker to represent their character and place it in a Sector.  
          The goal is to find and defeat the Leader of the Incursion OR Secure all the Sectors through Exploration. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the text assumes that every character Explores their own Sector, 
          but that does not have to be the case.  It is a tactical decision whether 
          to split up or not, and less combat capable heroes may wish to explore with an ally.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Threat Level</h4>
        <p>
          Every Incursion has a Threat level (T). The minimum Threat level is always 1.  
          The Threat level is usually the average Character Level of all of the characters.  
          Either write the number down or set a d20 on the table as a reminder of the Threat level.  
          It will be referenced throughout the Incursion.   
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Foes</h4>
        <p>
          By adding Foes to the Incursion, you add to a pool that will be randomly 
          picked from when a Character has an Encounter.  There are four types of Foes: 
          minions, elites, lieutenants and boss.  Input the name of the Foe and its 
          type for the Generator to use it.  The Generator treats minions and elites 
          as if there are an unlimited number, but each lieutenant and boss is unique.    
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Sectors</h4>
        <p>
          Sectors all have a standard format that begins with the Sector’s Name and Notes.  
          This is followed by the Challenge that will be required to Secure them.  
          A character can only perform this Challenge after they have fully Explored 
          the Sector or defeated an Elite Encounter.     
        </p>
        <p>
          After the Challenge there are four inputs: Ally, Treasure, Trap, and Encounter.  
          Think of each Sector like a deck of cards.  Every time it is Explored, 
          you pick a card and an event occurs.  These four inputs determine the number 
          and type of events in the deck.  The total number does not have to equal 10 - 
          it can be any number you like and it can be changed during play.      
        </p>
        <p>
          This section is followed by the Explore button, Secured checkbox and the 
          Reset button.  Every time the Explore button is pressed a random “card” 
          will be pulled and the event numbers will be decreased.  Checking the Secured 
          checkbox signals the Sector has been Secured.       
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Actions</h4>
        <p>
          Every round the heroes can perform one of the following actions: Move, 
          Explore, Fight, or Support.  If they choose to Move they can move to an 
          adjacent Sector.  If the hero encountered foes due to Exploring a Sector 
          they must Fight every round until the foes are defeated or the foes flee.  
          A character with the right abilities may Support another hero, as long as they 
          are within range of their abilities.    
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Exploring the Sectors</h4>
        <p>
          Every round that a player isn’t facing foes, a hero may explore the 
          sector it is in order to clear and secure them.  A sector must be explored 
          until an Elite foe is encountered and defeated.  After that any hero may 
          attempt to secure the Sector by performing a Challenge.     
        </p>
        <p>
          To Explore - press the “Explore” button of the Sector that the character is in.  
          The Generator will randomly select an Event.  The result of the exploration will 
          appear at the bottom of the Sector box (below the buttons or the last exploration result).  
          The Events correspond to the Event inputs above: an Ally, Treasure, Trap or Encounter.  
          An Encounter will tell you if it is an Elite foe.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Ally</h4>
        <p>
          When an Ally appears it signifies a friendly non-player character has been encountered.  
          Allies will (generally) aid your cause.  The exact nature of the ally is up to you, but their type is provided. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Treasure</h4>
        <p>
          Treasure either represents treasure found, or something taken from fallen foes.  
          The exact nature is up to you, but its type and rarity is provided.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Trap</h4>
        <p>
          Traps are set up by the Foes and their sole purpose is to harm and debilitate 
          the characters.  When the result of an exploration is a Trap, they must be 
          spotted and then successfully disarmed (or alternatively navigated around).  
          This is modeled by performing an Intelligence Check. Each Trap description 
          will include its effect type: ensnaring, pit, piercing, poison, element, etc. 
          and numbers in brackets: [-X/Y] (ex: piercing/puncturing [-4/1d4]).  
          -X represents the Check penalty, while the Y represents the Damage dice rolled on 
          a failure (a Saving Throw is allowed for half damage). 
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Encounter</h4>
        <p>
          Encounters are the heart of an Incursion - after all the point is to free 
          the Sectors from the threat of the Foes.  Each Encounter will usually 
          feature a handful (and up to a dozen) foes.  This will generally be minions, 
          but during an Elite Encounter they will be lead by either an elite, lieutenant or the boss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elite Encounters signify the major resistance of the Sector, and once defeated 
          it is assumed the remainder of the minions move to other Sectors to regroup.  
          Once the Elite Foe is vanquished the characters can then try to Secure the Sector by completing the Challenge.  
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Securing a Sector</h4>
        <p>
          To Secure a Sector a Character must successfully complete the listed Challenge.  
          The Challenge represents either an obstacle created by the Foes or results 
          from collateral damage cause by the Incursion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consult the section on Challenges for more information on how they are overcome.  
          All the Challenges are considered Relaxed - any number of failures is acceptable, 
          but it is a setback due to time.  Once this Challenge has been defeated the Sector 
          is secure and the players can focus on the other Sectors.  Check the Secured checkbox 
          to signify the Sector is Secured.

      <h3 class="center header">Challenges</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Challenges are thematic extended Attribute checks - the skill based equivalent to Fights.  
          There are eight types of Challenges: Burglary, Corruption, Disorder, Investigation, 
          Invention, Labor, Persuasion, and Puzzle.  Each Challenge has its own difficulty 
          and a specific number of Attribute Checks required to Overcome it.  
        </p>
        <p>
          When reading a Challenge they will always be written as Type [-X/Y].  
          Type is one of the 8 types of Challenges, X is the Attribute Check penalty, 
          and Y is the required number of Successes to Overcome it.
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Challenge Types</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Burglary:</strong> This challenge involves the theft of some item (small or large), 
          stealthy action, or other roguish business.  Such challenges rely on the arts 
          of breaking and entering and stealth.  Failures often results in fights 
          and being unable to obtain the goal.  
          </br><strong>Corruption:</strong>  Corruption is rampant and either no-one is aware, or no one 
          can stand up to it.  This challenge involves revealing and rooting it out.  
          The corruption could take the form of mob influence, a slumbering evil, 
          the presence of a sinister cult, or simply an official’s corrupt practice.  
          Failures may result in fights or simply a thorough beating.  
          </br><strong>Disorder:</strong>  The characters must re-establish the rule of law.  Chaos and 
          uncertainty rule, and men and women with cool heads who can plan and take 
          decisive action are necessary.  Even though there is disorder, fighting is 
          almost never the answer.  Failure usually results in the spread of more disorder.    
          </br><strong>Investigation:</strong>  Something has been lost, someone has been kidnapped, or a 
          more devious crime has been committed.  Sharp eyes, and quick wits are 
          required to track down clues and connect the threads to crack the case.  
          Failure usually results in trouble and a bad reputation for the investigator.  
          </br><strong>Invention:</strong>  Intelligence and ingenuity are required.  Something highly 
          technical and beyond the capability of most must be designed and built in 
          short order.  It may be a theory, invention, or medical breakthrough.  
          It doesn’t have to look good, but it had better work.  
          Alternately, the challenge may be to take apart something very dangerous 
          and highly technical.  Failure means others suffer.    
          </br><strong>Labor:</strong>  This challenge calls for strong backs, stamina, and the will to work.  
          A structure must be built, fields must re-planted, a road must be cut, the 
          river diverted, or the people must be fitted for war.  Failure means the 
          job goes undone and people are disheartened.     
          </br><strong>Persuasion:</strong>  The characters must sway someone’s will.  They will have to 
          rely on silver tongues, charisma, and rapport with the people.  They may 
          have to convince officials, settle a mob, or bring enemies to the table to 
          negotiate.  Failure usually results in increased hostility. 
          </br><strong>Puzzle:</strong>  It may be an actual physical puzzle, a riddle, or a game of skill 
          and wits. There is something esoteric that requires a calculating mind and 
          sharp wits to unravel.  Failure usually results in the loss of time or lost opportunity.  
        </p>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Performing Tests</h4>
        <p>
          All Challenges have a primary and a secondary Attribute that rely on.  
          Prior to performing a Challenge roll a 1d10 and consult the Challenge 
          Attribute Check table based upon the Type of Challenge that the character 
          is facing.  This determines the Attribute Check that is required for 
          that roll.  If a 10 is rolled - wildcard - pick an Attribute at random 
          to perform the Check.
        </p>
        <div class="center strong">Challenge Attribute Check Table</div>
        <table>

          <tr>
            <td>Puzzle</td>
            <td>Wisdom</td> 
            <td>Intelligence</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h4 class="center bar-bottom">Outcome</h4>
        <p>
          The outcome is dependent upon how strict the Challenge is.  A Challenge 
          can either be Relaxed, Lenient, or Strict.  In a Relaxed Challenge any 
          number of failures are allowed and as long a the character eventually 
          completes the required number of Attribute Checks succeed.  In a Lenient 
          Challenge, the number of Successes and the number of Failures must be 
          tracked.  After all the Checks are complete if the number of Successes 
          is greater than the Failures the character succeeds.  A Strict Challenge 
          is the most difficult, and if the character fails a Check at any time 
          during the Challenge they fail the Challenge.     
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on the type of Challenge failures can represent different things.  
          They may simply denote that more time or more resources are required to 
          complete the Challenge.  Alternately a character may suffer damage due 
          to the stress of failure.
